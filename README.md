# Pytorch
Basic Pytorch tutorials for those interested in learning this package. PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python and is completely based on Torch. It is primarily used for applications such as natural language processing, computer vision etc and also helps in making deep learning models. PyTorch is developed by Facebook's artificial-intelligence research group along with Uber's "Pyro" software for the concept of in-built probabilistic programming.
This package performs operations on mathematical objects known as Tensors which are multidimensional arrays and are used to describe physical properties just like Scalars and Vectors. A scalar is a zero rank tensor and a vector is a first rank tensor.
I recommend you to have knowledge of Python and few concepts related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning before proceeding with the notebook tutorials.
